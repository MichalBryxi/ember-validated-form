# Configuration

Currently, the configuration supports only the `bootstrap` theme:

{{docs-snippet name='config.js' title='config/environment.js'}}

The idea for the future is to support various commonly used CSS frameworks
like UIkit, Semantic UI or Bulma. **Pull Requests implementing such a theme
are more than welcome!**
