  model        = (changeset model UserValidations)
  on-submit    = (action "submit")
  on-cancel    = (action "cancel")
  submit-label = 'Save' as |f|}}
  {{!-- form content --}}
{{/validated-form}}
```

After:
```Handlebars
{{#validated-form
  model        = (changeset model UserValidations)
  on-submit    = (action "submit")
  as |f|}}
  {{!-- form content --}}
  {{f.submit label='Save'}}
  <button {{action="cancel"}}>Cancel</button>
